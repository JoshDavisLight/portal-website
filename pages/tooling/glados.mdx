# Glados

Glados is a health monitoring service for the Portal Network. It is a set of utilities and a dashboard that allows users to view what 
content is available in the Portal Network and search the network for specific data.

The Glados monitor continually foloows the tip of the Ethereum blockchain and computes Portal Network content keys for each new block.
These content keys are then pushed into a database. Glados can then 'audit' by requesting each content key in the Glados database from a Portal Network client using JSON-RPC.
The success or failure of the query is recorded in the Glados database, acting as an availability flag for individual pieces of content.

This information can be explored using the Glados dashboard.
