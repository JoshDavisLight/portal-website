## tldr

The Portal Network aims to build a decentralized peer-to-peer network that enables lightweight protocol access to the Ethereum protocol. (What are nodes and clients?)
We define “lightweight protocol access to mean”:

- Minimized or zero syncing.
- Accessible to resource-constrained devices (1GB ram, 100mB disk, 1CPU)
- Consumer grade internet connection (TODO: what does this mean).

We want clients for this network to be able to enter the network and retrieve arbitrary data within a few seconds.

Light clients can sync fast, run on resource-low hardware and use less bandwidth. To keep decentralizing Ethereum, the Portal Network has to overcome many challenges.

Portal's research and development is focused on:
- Reduction of hardware and bandwidth requirements needed to run a client
- No dependency on Full Nodes
- Individually tunable resource requirements
- Support for known retrieval patterns
- No Centralization points

In the [endgame](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) we expect that most individuals will trnasact on Ethereum using light clients without knowing it!
