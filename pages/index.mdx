## What we do

<SummaryIcons />

Portal network aims to deliver **light weight access to Ethereum**.

Clients for this network will be able to connect and start retrieving data within a few seconds on small devices and low bandwidth.

Ultimately, we envision the majority of users interacting with Ethereum through Portal light clients, probably without even knowing it!
