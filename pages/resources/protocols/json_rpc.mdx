# JSON-RPC

### Portal Network
Portaln Network clients expose a specified set of endpoints over JSON-RPC to allow users to interact with the Portal Network. The specification for these endpoints can be found [here](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/assembled-spec/jsonrpc/openrpc.json&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:splitView%5D=false&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:input%5D=false&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:examplesDropdown%5D=false). Individual Portal clients may be at different stages of development, which might affect which endpoints are currently supported.

### Ethereum json-rpc api
Portal clients plan to eventually support the entire [Ethereum JSON-RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#json-rpc-methods). Individual Portal clients may be at different stages of development, which might affect which endpoints are currently supported.

### Client-Specific
Portal clients are free to support their own custom json-rpc endpoints. Please refer to a respective Portal client's documentation to find any custom endpoints that are supported.
