## Getting Started

Install packages (requires nodejs installation):

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Editing Content

To edit content locate files named "page.tsx" in the /src/app directory - these can be nested too if the app has multiple pages (nextjs app dir convention)

`menu` adjustments can be made in `src/app/menu.tsx`
